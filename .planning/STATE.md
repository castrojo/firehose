## Quick Task 001: Dependabot Automation Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~44 seconds  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, ready to push

**Objective:** Automate dependency updates via Dependabot with SHA-pinned GitHub Actions for improved security and reduced maintenance.

**What was done:**
1. Created `.github/dependabot.yml` with npm (daily) and GitHub Actions (weekly) ecosystems
2. Converted 4 GitHub Actions to SHA-pinned versions:
   - actions/checkout@v4 → @34e11487... # v4
   - actions/setup-node@v4 → @49933ea5... # v4
   - actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 → @56afc609... # v3
   - actions/deploy-pages@v4 → @d6db9016... # v4
3. Grouped npm updates by production/development dependencies

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic security patches (including lodash vulnerability via @astrojs/check)
- ✅ SHA-pinned actions prevent tag hijacking
- ✅ Reduced manual maintenance burden
- ✅ Grouped updates reduce PR noise

**Next:** Push to origin to enable Dependabot automation

**Commit:** c1e3341 "chore(deps): automate dependency updates via dependabot"

## Quick Task 002: Keyboard Navigation Fix Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~6 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, ready to push

**Objective:** Fix keyboard navigation to skip hidden cards in collapsed sections, allow j/k to focus collapse buttons, and enable Enter to expand/collapse.

**What was done:**
1. Updated KeyboardNavigator selector to exclude hidden cards: `.release-card:not([aria-hidden="true"] .release-card), .collapse-button`
2. Modified `openFocused()` to detect collapse buttons and trigger click instead of opening link
3. Added `collapseStateChanged` event dispatching after expand/collapse animations
4. Added event listener in KeyboardNavigator to refresh on state changes
5. Extended CSS focus styling to collapse buttons

**Problem solved:**
- Before: j/k iterated through hidden cards inside collapsed sections, making navigation feel broken
- After: j/k skips hidden cards and focuses collapse buttons, providing natural navigation flow

**Results:**
- ✅ j/k navigation skips hidden cards inside collapsed sections
- ✅ Collapse buttons receive focus and show visual indicator
- ✅ Enter/o expands/collapses focused collapse button
- ✅ Navigation automatically refreshes after state changes
- ✅ Human verification: All scenarios tested and approved

**Technical approach:**
- CSS selector filtering (`:not([aria-hidden="true"] .release-card)`) for performance
- CustomEvent pattern for decoupled component communication
- Type detection pattern for handling different navigable item types

**Commits:**
- f96ebd0 "docs(quick-002): create plan for keyboard nav with collapsed sections"
- 4df7b83 "feat(quick-002): update keyboard navigation to track visible items only"
- 6d22d59 "feat(quick-002): add collapse state change event dispatching"

## v1.3.1 Bugfix: Prerelease Grouping Fix

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Deployed

**Issue:** Parallel prerelease tracks (e.g., NATS v2.11.12-RC.X and v2.12.4-RC.X) were not grouped together, creating separate groups and defeating the purpose of collapse.

**Root Cause:** Algorithm grouped by project + minor version series, treating v2.11.12 and v2.12.4 as different series.

**Solution:** Added special handling for prerelease versions:
- Modified `groupReleases()` in `src/lib/releaseGrouping.ts`
- If both releases are prereleases from same project → always group together
- If both are stable releases → group by minor series (unchanged)
- Handles parallel development tracks correctly

**Results:**
- NATS now shows "3 more releases" (was separate groups)
- All RC versions collapse together: v2.11.12-RC.7, RC.6, v2.12.4-RC.5, RC.4
- User-reported issue fixed

**Algorithm:**
```typescript
canCollapse = 
  sameProject &&
  (bothPrereleases || (bothStable && sameMinorSeries))
```

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/ (2026-01-27 03:35 UTC)

## v1.3 Enhancement: Collapsible Minor Releases Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, ready to deploy

**Issue:** Projects with frequent releases (NATS, Kubernetes, etc.) dominated the feed, making it hard to scan for major releases.

**Solution:** Intelligent grouping with expand/collapse UI:
- Created semantic version parser (`src/lib/semver.ts`)
  - Handles v1.2.3, 1.2.3, prerelease tags (v1.0.0-rc.1)
  - Compares versions, detects release types (major/minor/patch)
  - Identifies releases in same minor series
- Created grouping logic (`src/lib/releaseGrouping.ts`)
  - Groups consecutive releases by project + minor version
  - Same project + same minor series → collapse together
  - Different major/minor versions → separate groups
- Created CollapsibleReleaseGroup component
  - Shows most recent release expanded
  - "X more releases" button for collapsed items
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation (300ms)
  - ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Modified index.astro to use grouping

**Results:**
- 4 collapsible groups detected in initial batch (30 releases)
- Each shows "1 more release" or "X more releases" button
- Click to expand reveals older releases in same series
- Keyboard navigation still works (j/k/o/?)
- Search and filters remain functional
- Responsive design maintained

**Algorithm:**
```
For each release in sorted list (newest first):
  Parse version from title
  If same project AND same minor series as previous:
    → Add to previous group's collapsed releases
  Else:
    → Start new group (always expanded)
```

**Files:**
- `src/lib/semver.ts` - Version parsing, comparison, classification
- `src/lib/releaseGrouping.ts` - Grouping logic
- `src/components/CollapsibleReleaseGroup.astro` - UI component
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Integration

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/ (2026-01-27 03:27 UTC)

## v1.2 Enhancement: Description Truncation Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Deployed

**Issue:** Long project descriptions (some 5+ sentences) created visual clutter and reduced readability.

**Solution:** Implemented intelligent sentence-aware truncation:
- Created `truncate.ts` utility with smart sentence boundary detection
- Limits descriptions to 2 sentences maximum
- Appends "..." when text is truncated
- Preserves full description in `title` attribute for hover tooltip
- Handles periods, exclamation marks, and question marks correctly

**Results:**
- Keycloak: 11 sentences → 2 sentences
- Dapr: 3 sentences → 2 sentences
- NATS: 3 sentences → 2 sentences
- Falco: 4 sentences → 2 sentences
- Short descriptions (≤2 sentences) unchanged

**Files:**
- `src/lib/truncate.ts` - New truncation utility
- `src/components/ReleaseCard.astro` - Integration and title attribute

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/ (2026-01-27 03:20 UTC)

## Phase 6: CNCF Branding Summary

## v1.1 Bug Fix Milestone Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

**Issue:** Search completely broken after UI enhancement deployment
**Root Cause:** SearchBar CSS assumed full-width layout, failed in grid column context
**Fix:** Removed max-width constraints, let SearchBar fill available width

**Changes:**
- `.search-wrapper`: Changed from `max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto` to `width: 100%`
- `.search-results`: Removed `max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto`, added `width: 100%`
- Search now works correctly in sidebar layout

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/
**Commit:** 2f78c8d "fix(search): adjust SearchBar width for sidebar layout"

- marked@17.0.1 for GitHub-compatible markdown
- Intersection Observer for infinite scroll
- Pagefind for search (fixed in v1.1)
- Data attributes for client-side filtering
- Inline Astro scripts for client-side logic
- Vim-style keyboard shortcuts (j/k/o/?)
- Promise.allSettled() for graceful degradation
- Graduated + Incubating projects only (~62 feeds)
- Atom feeds only (GitHub releases don't support RSS)
- Node.js 20 (LTS) for GitHub Actions

- Sidebar layout with natural scrolling (not sticky)
- Two-column grid layout (320px sidebar + flexible content)
- CNCF brand colors via CSS custom properties
- InfoBox component for sidebar link sections
- Logo mapper with /firehose base path for GitHub Pages

Phase 6 Decisions:
- Use CSS custom properties for CNCF colors (enables consistent theming without build complexity)
- CNCF Pink (#D62293) for links (matching cncf.io/blog, not blue)
- CNCF Blue (#0086FF) for accents and active states
- Direct hex values instead of CSS var() references (avoids resolution issues)
- Create reusable InfoBox component matching existing sidebar patterns
- Implement logo mapper with edge case handling (open-policy-agent → opa, the-update-framework → tuf)
- Download logos from cncf/artwork repository (official source)
- Non-sticky sidebar for natural scrolling behavior

v1.3 Decisions:
- Use semantic versioning parser (handles v1.2.3, 1.2.3, prerelease tags)
- Group consecutive releases by project + minor version series
- Always show most recent release expanded
- Collapse older releases in same minor series under "X more releases" button
- Smooth 300ms animation for expand/collapse
- Maintain ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Preserve keyboard navigation (j/k works with groups)

Quick Task 001 Decisions:
- SHA-pinned GitHub Actions for immutable security (full 40-char SHA)
- Version comments (# v4) for human readability
- Grouped npm updates (production vs development) to reduce PR noise
- Daily npm checks for aggressive security patching
- Weekly GitHub Actions checks for CI/CD stability
- Dependabot commit prefixes: chore(deps) for npm, chore(actions) for GitHub Actions
