## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent technology stack decisions:
- Astro v5 Content Layer API for build-time aggregation ✅ Working
- rss-parser + js-yaml for robust parsing ✅ Working
- marked@17.0.1 for GitHub-compatible markdown ✅ Working
- Intersection Observer for infinite scroll ✅ Working
- Pagefind for search ✅ Working (04-01)
- Data attributes for client-side filtering ✅ Working (04-02)
- Inline Astro scripts for client-side logic ✅ Working (04-03)
- Vim-style keyboard shortcuts (j/k/o/?) ✅ Working (04-03)
- Promise.allSettled() for graceful degradation ✅ Working
- Graduated + Incubating projects only for v1 (~100 feeds)
- Atom feeds only (GitHub releases don't support RSS)
- Node.js 20 (LTS) for GitHub Actions ✅ Working (05-02)
- Modern GitHub Actions v4 with two-job workflow ✅ Working (05-02)
- Daily builds at 6 AM UTC ✅ Configured (05-02)
- @ts-nocheck for inline Astro scripts ✅ Working (05-01)

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full details and rationale.

### Pending Todos

- Plan Phase 5 (Deployment & Automation)
- Review backlog items:
  - Truncate long project descriptions (2-3 sentences max)
  - Collapse minor releases (show major releases prominently)
  - Future: CNCF branding (separate milestone)

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 4 complete with all criteria met.
