## v1.3 Enhancement: Collapsible Minor Releases Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Complete, ready to deploy

**Issue:** Projects with frequent releases (NATS, Kubernetes, etc.) dominated the feed, making it hard to scan for major releases.

**Solution:** Intelligent grouping with expand/collapse UI:
- Created semantic version parser (`src/lib/semver.ts`)
  - Handles v1.2.3, 1.2.3, prerelease tags (v1.0.0-rc.1)
  - Compares versions, detects release types (major/minor/patch)
  - Identifies releases in same minor series
- Created grouping logic (`src/lib/releaseGrouping.ts`)
  - Groups consecutive releases by project + minor version
  - Same project + same minor series → collapse together
  - Different major/minor versions → separate groups
- Created CollapsibleReleaseGroup component
  - Shows most recent release expanded
  - "X more releases" button for collapsed items
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation (300ms)
  - ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Modified index.astro to use grouping

**Results:**
- 4 collapsible groups detected in initial batch (30 releases)
- Each shows "1 more release" or "X more releases" button
- Click to expand reveals older releases in same series
- Keyboard navigation still works (j/k/o/?)
- Search and filters remain functional
- Responsive design maintained

**Algorithm:**
```
For each release in sorted list (newest first):
  Parse version from title
  If same project AND same minor series as previous:
    → Add to previous group's collapsed releases
  Else:
    → Start new group (always expanded)
```

**Files:**
- `src/lib/semver.ts` - Version parsing, comparison, classification
- `src/lib/releaseGrouping.ts` - Grouping logic
- `src/components/CollapsibleReleaseGroup.astro` - UI component
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Integration

**Deployed:** Ready to push to production

## v1.2 Enhancement: Description Truncation Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Deployed

**Issue:** Long project descriptions (some 5+ sentences) created visual clutter and reduced readability.

**Solution:** Implemented intelligent sentence-aware truncation:
- Created `truncate.ts` utility with smart sentence boundary detection
- Limits descriptions to 2 sentences maximum
- Appends "..." when text is truncated
- Preserves full description in `title` attribute for hover tooltip
- Handles periods, exclamation marks, and question marks correctly

**Results:**
- Keycloak: 11 sentences → 2 sentences
- Dapr: 3 sentences → 2 sentences
- NATS: 3 sentences → 2 sentences
- Falco: 4 sentences → 2 sentences
- Short descriptions (≤2 sentences) unchanged

**Files:**
- `src/lib/truncate.ts` - New truncation utility
- `src/components/ReleaseCard.astro` - Integration and title attribute

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/ (2026-01-27 03:20 UTC)

## Phase 6: CNCF Branding Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-26  
**Duration:** ~3 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (2/2 plans)

### Plan 06-01 Complete (Infrastructure):

- InfoBox component created for sidebar link sections
- Logo mapper utility built with edge case handling
- All branding infrastructure ready for visual integration

### Plan 06-02 Complete (Visual Integration):
- Applied official CNCF blog theme (pink links #D62293, blue accents #0086FF)
- Downloaded 56 project logos from cncf/artwork repository
- Integrated InfoBox into sidebar with CNCF links (Homepage, Landscape, GitHub)
- Added project logos to all release cards (32x32px with responsive sizing)
- Enhanced card design with subtle shadows and clean white backgrounds
- Fixed logo paths to include /firehose base path
- Removed sticky sidebar positioning for natural scroll behavior
- Human verified: All visual elements working correctly

**Visual Identity:**
- ✅ CNCF Pink (#D62293) for all links (matching cncf.io/blog)
- ✅ CNCF Blue (#0086FF) for accents and active buttons
- ✅ Light gray background (#fdfdfd) like CNCF site

- `src/components/ReleaseCard.astro` - Logo display, enhanced card styling
- `src/lib/logoMapper.ts` - Logo path resolution with /firehose base
- `public/logos/` - 56 project logos + placeholder SVG

## v1.1 Bug Fix Milestone Summary

**Completed:** 2026-01-27  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes

**Issue:** Search completely broken after UI enhancement deployment
**Root Cause:** SearchBar CSS assumed full-width layout, failed in grid column context
**Fix:** Removed max-width constraints, let SearchBar fill available width

**Changes:**
- `.search-wrapper`: Changed from `max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto` to `width: 100%`
- `.search-results`: Removed `max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto`, added `width: 100%`
- Search now works correctly in sidebar layout

**Deployed:** https://castrojo.github.io/firehose/
**Commit:** 2f78c8d "fix(search): adjust SearchBar width for sidebar layout"

- ✅ Fixed keyboard navigation scroll alignment (j/k to top)
- ✅ Made focus indicator more subtle (soft shadow)
- ✅ Redesigned filters with modern styling
- ✅ Created responsive sidebar layout (320px sidebar + flexible content)
- ✅ Moved stats to sidebar
- ✅ Moved filters to sidebar

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Technology stack - All working ✅:
- Astro v5 Content Layer API for build-time aggregation
- rss-parser + js-yaml for robust parsing
- marked@17.0.1 for GitHub-compatible markdown
- Intersection Observer for infinite scroll
- Pagefind for search (fixed in v1.1)
- Data attributes for client-side filtering
- Inline Astro scripts for client-side logic
- Vim-style keyboard shortcuts (j/k/o/?)
- Promise.allSettled() for graceful degradation
- Graduated + Incubating projects only (~62 feeds)
- Atom feeds only (GitHub releases don't support RSS)
- Node.js 20 (LTS) for GitHub Actions
- Modern GitHub Actions v4 with two-job workflow
- Daily builds at 6 AM UTC
- Sidebar layout with natural scrolling (not sticky)
- Two-column grid layout (320px sidebar + flexible content)
- CNCF brand colors via CSS custom properties
- InfoBox component for sidebar link sections
- Logo mapper with /firehose base path for GitHub Pages

Phase 6 Decisions:
- Use CSS custom properties for CNCF colors (enables consistent theming without build complexity)
- CNCF Pink (#D62293) for links (matching cncf.io/blog, not blue)
- CNCF Blue (#0086FF) for accents and active states
- Direct hex values instead of CSS var() references (avoids resolution issues)
- Create reusable InfoBox component matching existing sidebar patterns
- Implement logo mapper with edge case handling (open-policy-agent → opa, the-update-framework → tuf)
- Download logos from cncf/artwork repository (official source)
- Non-sticky sidebar for natural scrolling behavior

v1.3 Decisions:
- Use semantic versioning parser (handles v1.2.3, 1.2.3, prerelease tags)
- Group consecutive releases by project + minor version series
- Always show most recent release expanded
- Collapse older releases in same minor series under "X more releases" button
- Smooth 300ms animation for expand/collapse
- Maintain ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Preserve keyboard navigation (j/k works with groups)

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full details and rationale.
