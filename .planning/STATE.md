### Pending Todos

- Plan Phase 5 (Deployment & Automation)
- Review backlog items:
  - Truncate long project descriptions (2-3 sentences max)
  - Collapse minor releases (show major releases prominently)
  - Future: CNCF branding (separate milestone)

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 4 complete with all criteria met.
