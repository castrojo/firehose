          "description": "fix(userspace)!: show source config path only in debug builds\n  Starting from Falco 0.40, the `falco --help` output incorrectly showed\n  the source config path (e.g., /home/runner/work/falco/falco/falco.yaml)\n  in release packages. This path was intended only for local development.\n  The issue was introduced when RelWithDebInfo build type support was\n  added (commit 6bf33ff). The existing code checked for BUILD_TYPE_RELEASE\n  to determine release behavior, but RelWithDebInfo builds defined\n  BUILD_TYPE_RELWITHDEBINFO instead, causing them to fall into the\n  debug code path.\n  This fix introduces BUILD_TYPE_DEBUG and changes the conditionals to\n  enable dev features only when CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is explicitly \"debug\".\n  Both Release and RelWithDebInfo builds now correctly show only\n  /etc/falco/falco.yaml.\n  Fixes the regression introduced in 0.40.0\nSigned-off-by: Leonardo Grasso <me@leonardograsso.com>\nSigned-off-by: Leonardo Di Giovanna <leonardodigiovanna1@gmail.com>",

          "description": "Upgrade Guide\nTo upgrade from previous versions of Rook, see the Rook upgrade guide.\nBreaking Changes\nThe supported Kubernetes versions are v1.30 - v1.35\nThe minimum supported Ceph version is v19.2.0. Rook v1.18 clusters running Ceph v18 must upgrade\nThe behavior of the activeStandby property in the CephFilesystem CRD has changed. When set to false, the standby MDS daemon deployment will be scaled down and removed, rather than only disabling the standby cache while the daemon remains running.\nHelm: The rook-ceph-cluster chart has changed where the Ceph image is defined, to allow separate settings for the repository and tag. For more details, see the Rook upgrade guide.\nIn external mode, when users provide a Ceph admin keyring to Rook, Rook will no longer create CSI Ceph clients automatically. This approach will provide more consistency to configure external mode clusters via the same external Python script.\nFeatures\nExperimental: NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) allows RBD volumes to be exposed and accessed via the NVMe/TCP protocol. This enables both Kubernetes pods within the cluster and external clients outside the cluster to connect to Ceph block storage using standard NVMe-oF initiators, providing high-performance block storage access over the network. See the NVMe-oF Configuration Guide to get started.\nCephCSI v3.16 Integration:\n\nNVMe-oF CSI driver for provisioning and mounting volumes over the NVMe over Fabrics protocol\nImproved fencing for RBD and CephFS volumes during node failure\nBlock volume usage statistics\nConfigurable block encryption cipher\nExperimental: Allow concurrent reconciles of the CephCluster CR when there multiple clusters being managed by the same Rook operator. Concurrency is enabled by increasing the operator setting ROOK_RECONCILE_CONCURRENT_CLUSTERS to a value greater than 1.\nImproved logging with namespaced names for the controllers for more consistency in troubleshooting the rook operator log.",
